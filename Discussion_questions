  Part 1 Discussion:
The beta and gamma parameters affect the behavior of the graphs in the following way: as beta increases,
the rate that individuals infected spikes increases more quickly and as gamma increases, the amount of 
time for total recovery to be reached decreases. If both values increase then the total time it takes for
the disease to run its course and immunity to be obtained decreases. This intuitively matches my expectations
because a disease with a quicker rate of transmission but the same rate of recovery will end up going through
the population quicker as the total population in recovery at a given time before the spike in infections will
be greater. The same reasoning holds for the recovery rate, if the transmission rate is kept constant but the
recovery rate is increased then the amount of recovered individuals at a given time will be greater then the
same time for a lower recovery rate. 

  Part 2 Discussion: 
The quadratic interpolation method finds a smaller error for recovered individuals but larger error for susceptible and infected individuals.  

  Part 3 Discussion:
Using 10 days of data instead of 30 affects the estimates of I(0) and B differently. The estimate of I(0) 
doesn’t get better because there are fewer data points, making it harder to get an accurate fit, and small
errors have a bigger impact. On the other hand, the estimate of B, the transmission rate, actually improves.
This is because most of the disease transmission happens in the first 10 days, and using just this period 
makes the model simpler and more accurate for estimating B. Using more days adds complexity as the disease’s
behavior changes, which makes estimating B harder. Therefore, fewer days hurt the accuracy of I(0) but make B 
easier to estimate.
